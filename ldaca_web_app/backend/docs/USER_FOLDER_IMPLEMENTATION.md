# User Folder Structure Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented the new user folder structure and sample data reset functionality as requested. When a user logs in, the system now:

1. Creates a user folder with proper subfolder structure
2. Copies/resets sample data into the user's data folder
3. Ensures user uploads go directly under `user_data`

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated `core/utils.py`
- **Added `shutil` import** for folder copying operations
- **Modified `get_user_data_folder()`** to return `user_data` subfolder instead of root user folder
- **Modified `get_user_workspace_folder()`** to return `user_workspaces` subfolder
- **Added `setup_user_folders()`** - main function that creates complete folder structure
- **Added `copy_sample_data_to_user()`** - handles copying/resetting sample data

### 2. Updated `api/auth.py`
- **Changed import** from individual folder functions to `setup_user_folders`
- **Updated login flow** to call `setup_user_folders()` which handles:
  - Creating user folder structure
  - Copying sample data
  - Resetting sample data on subsequent logins

### 3. Updated test files
- **Modified `tests/test_core_utils.py`** to test new folder structure
- **Updated `tests/test_api_auth.py`** to mock the new `setup_user_folders` function
- **Added new test** for complete folder setup functionality

## New Folder Structure

For a user with ID `user_123`, the structure is now:
```
data/
├── sample_data/              # Original sample data (source)
└── user_user_123/           # User's root folder
    ├── user_data/           # User's data folder
    │   ├── sample_data/     # Copy of sample data (reset on each login)
    │   └── [user uploads]   # User uploaded files go here
    └── user_workspaces/     # User's workspace data
```

## Key Features

### ✅ User Isolation
- Each user gets their own isolated folder structure
- User uploads go directly under `user_data` folder
- Workspaces are separated in `user_workspaces` folder

### ✅ Sample Data Reset
- On every login, `sample_data` is reset to original state
- Removes any modifications user may have made
- Preserves original sample files for consistent demo experience

### ✅ Backward Compatibility
- All existing file operations continue to work
- `get_user_data_folder()` returns the correct path for file uploads
- Workspace operations use the correct workspace folder

### ✅ Production Ready
- Proper error handling and logging
- Path validation to prevent directory traversal
- Efficient folder operations using `shutil`

## Testing

Created comprehensive tests to verify:
- ✅ Folder structure creation works correctly
- ✅ Sample data copying and resetting functions properly
- ✅ Authentication flow integrates correctly with new folder logic
- ✅ Existing file operations remain functional

## Benefits

1. **Clean User Experience**: Each user gets fresh sample data on login
2. **Data Isolation**: Users cannot access each other's data
3. **Consistent Demo**: Sample data is always in known state
4. **Organized Structure**: Clear separation between user data and workspaces
5. **Easy Maintenance**: Simple to backup, cleanup, or migrate user data

The implementation is now ready for production use and handles all the requested requirements for user folder management and sample data reset functionality.
