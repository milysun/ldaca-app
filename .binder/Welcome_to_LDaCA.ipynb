    "# üéØ Welcome to LDaCA - Language Data Commons of Australia\n",
    "\n",
    "## üìã What is LDaCA?\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Language Data Commons of Australia (LDaCA)** is a comprehensive platform for discovering, accessing, and working with language and speech data. This BinderHub deployment provides an interactive environment where you can:\n",
    "\n",
    "- üîç Explore language datasets and collections\n",
    "- üìä Analyze linguistic data using the DocFrame and DocWorkspace libraries\n",
    "- üöÄ Work with the LDaCA web application and API\n",
    "- üìù Create and share research notebooks\n",
    "\n",
    "## üöÄ Getting Started in BinderHub\n",
    "\n",
    "### LDaCA Web Application\n",
    "\n",
    "The LDaCA web application is running in this container and accessible through Jupyter's server proxy:\n",
    "\n",
    "**üåê [Access LDaCA Web App ‚Üí](../proxy/443/)**\n",
    "\n",
    "This will open the LDaCA interface where you can:\n",
    "- Browse language data collections\n",
    "- Search and filter datasets\n",
    "- View metadata and documentation\n",
    "- Access data files\n",
    "\n",
    "### API Access\n",
    "\n",
    "The LDaCA FastAPI backend is also available:\n",
    "\n",
    "**üîß [LDaCA API Documentation ‚Üí](../proxy/8001/docs)**\n",
    "\n",
    "## üìö Available Libraries\n",
    "\n",
    "This environment includes the core LDaCA libraries:\n",
    "\n",
    "### DocFrame\n",
    "A powerful library for working with document collections:\n",
    "- Load and manipulate text corpora\n",
    "- Extract metadata and content\n",
    "- Perform text analysis operations\n",
    "\n",
    "### DocWorkspace  \n",
    "Workspace management for document collections:\n",
    "- Organize and structure data\n",
    "- Create reproducible workflows\n",
    "- Manage file operations\n",
    "\n",
    "## üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Quick Start Examples\n",
    "\n",
    "Click the links below to explore example notebooks:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Basic Usage**: Introduction to DocFrame and DocWorkspace\n",
    "- **Data Exploration**: Working with language datasets\n",
    "- **Text Analysis**: Common text processing tasks\n",
    "- **API Integration**: Using the LDaCA web API\n",
    "\n",
    "## üí° Tips for BinderHub Users\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Persistent Work**: Your work will be preserved during the session but may be lost when the container stops\n",
    "2. **File Management**: Use the file browser on the left to navigate and create files\n",
    "3. **Multiple Services**: The LDaCA web app runs alongside Jupyter - both are available simultaneously\n",
    "4. **Help Resources**: Check the `examples/` directory for sample notebooks and data\n",
    "\n",
    "## üîß Technical Details\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Python Environment**: Python 3.10 with LDaCA libraries pre-installed\n",
    "- **Services**: nginx (port 443), FastAPI backend (port 8001), Jupyter Lab\n",
    "- **Data Location**: Sample data available in `examples/data/`\n",
    "- **Service Management**: All services managed via supervisor daemon\n",
